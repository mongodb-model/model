The native MongoDB driver for Node.js is called the "MongoDB Node.js Driver" or simply the "Node.js driver". It is the official MongoDB driver for Node.js, developed and maintained by MongoDB Inc. The Node.js driver allows developers to connect to and interact with MongoDB databases using JavaScript or TypeScript.

Here are some key features and capabilities of the Node.js driver:

Connection management: The driver provides methods to establish connections to MongoDB databases, including support for replica sets and sharded clusters.

CRUD operations: It offers a comprehensive set of APIs for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on MongoDB documents. You can insert, update, and delete documents, as well as query and retrieve data from the database.

Index management: The driver allows you to create, modify, and drop indexes on MongoDB collections. Indexes help optimize query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.

Aggregation framework: The Node.js driver supports MongoDB's powerful Aggregation Framework, which enables complex data processing and analysis operations on the server-side.

GridFS support: GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB. The Node.js driver provides APIs to work with GridFS, allowing you to store and retrieve files larger than the 16MB document size limit.

Transactions: The driver supports transactions, which provide atomicity and isolation guarantees for multiple operations, ensuring data consistency across documents and collections.

Change streams: Change streams allow you to listen for changes happening in the database in real-time. The Node.js driver supports change streams, enabling applications to react to data changes as they occur.

The Node.js driver is available through the npm package manager. You can install it by running npm install mongodb in your Node.js project directory. The driver provides a straightforward and efficient way to interact with MongoDB databases in a Node.js environment.
