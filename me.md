Yes. However, it comes with the following agreements: "If you have an Assistance Animal or Emotional Support Animal, you will be responsible for all and every bill for all cleaning including but not limited to hair removal, and all other cleanings (animal hair removal, pop removal, pee removal, etc â€¦), all and every damage caused by your pet. If your animal bites or attempts to bite at any given moment it will be swiftly reported to both the police and authorities of the State of Utah and you and your animal will be removed from the premise immediately and your door code will be deactivated. You will also be billed without negotiation for all and every medical expense from your pet's bite.  If you are removed from the premises because of your violation of the rules or because your pet puts other guests or the host or the neighbors' lives in danger, you will be fully responsible for the next place to stay."
