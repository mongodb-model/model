Hey there, my friend!

Just wanted to give you a quick update on my phone situation. Unfortunately, it's been acting up lately, and getting it fixed is turning out to be a bit more time-consuming than I expected. If things don't work out by the end of this week, I might have to bite the bullet and look into getting a new phone.

I know this might cause a bit of communication glitch, so if you've tried reaching out to me through calls or texts and I haven't responded, please don't think I'm ignoring you! The good news is that my WhatsApp on my computer and my trusty email are still up and running. You can catch me there at +1.385.732.4448 or drop me a line at ericson.weah@gmail.com.

On a different note, that upstairs room I've been preparing is finally ready. Before I officially list it on Airbnb, I thought I'd touch base with you. In case you might be interested in a stay?

Thanks for your understanding, and let's catch up soon!

Best regards,
Ericson Weah
